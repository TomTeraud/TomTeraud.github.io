In this blog post, I'm sharing a small C program that implements the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of numbers. I developed this program as part of my journey to better understand recursion in programming.

Why Merge Sort?

Merge sort is a classic example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It intrigued me because of its elegant recursive approach to sorting. By breaking the problem down into smaller sub-problems, sorting each sub-array individually, and then merging them back together, merge sort achieves efficient sorting with a time complexity of O(n log n).

The Learning Process

While working on this program, I dove into the world of recursive algorithms. Understanding how merge sort divides the problem into smaller and more manageable tasks helped me grasp the power of recursion in solving complex problems.

I've made the source code available on my GitHub repository, where you can explore the complete implementation. Feel free to check it out: <a href="https://github.com/TomTeraud/merge_sort" target="_blank">https://github.com/TomTeraud/merge_sort</a>
