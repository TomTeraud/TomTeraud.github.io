I developed a dynamic e-commerce prototype web application as part of my CS50x final project. This application serves as a platform for selling clothes online, utilizing Python and Flask as the primary technologies.
The application is deployed on Google Cloud Platform's App Engine, ensuring scalability and reliable performance.
