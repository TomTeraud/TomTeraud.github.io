**Experience the Fun: "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" Console Game**

I'm thrilled to present my latest project - a console version of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock," now with computer players! Challenge yourself in the terminal and compete against the computer for the most wins.

**Why I Built It**

As a beginner programmer, I wanted to showcase my skills through an enjoyable project. "Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock" allowed me to combine game mechanics with coding.

**How to Play**

The rules are easy to grasp - choose "Rock," "Paper," "Scissors," "Lizard," or "Spock," and see who wins! I've added a twist with computer players, each with their own style and strategy.

**In Your Terminal**

Enjoy the game right in your terminal! No fancy graphics, just pure fun and coding.

**Try It Out**

Ready to play? Test your skills and challenge the computer players. The code is available on my GitHub repository:
