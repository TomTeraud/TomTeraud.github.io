Hello, I'm Toms, a self-employed handyman with a growing passion for programming and software development. I've embarked on a journey to expand my horizons and explore the world of coding alongside my handyman work.

My enthusiasm for learning has led me to dive into various programming languages and computer science principles. I'm proud to have completed CS50x, which has given me a solid foundation in the fundamentals of software development.

Continual learning is my mantra, and I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to enhance my skills in software development. At present, I'm actively engaged in personal coding projects, all in the pursuit of honing my expertise.

You're invited to explore my [GitHub](https://github.com/TomTeraud) profile, where I share my ongoing programming endeavors. While I'm still in the early stages of my software development journey, I'm committed to continuous growth and embracing new challenges with enthusiasm.

If you're in search of a dedicated and motivated software developer with a strong foundation, a passion for learning, and an unwavering commitment to excellence, I'm eager to connect and collaborate on meaningful projects.
