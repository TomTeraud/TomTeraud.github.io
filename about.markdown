Hi, Iâ€™m Toms. I'm a lifelong learner who finds joy in exploring, experimenting, fixing, and creating.

As a motivated software developer with a background in home improvement, I am driven to pursue a fulfilling career in software development. Recently, I made a transition to programming and successfully completed CS50x, which provided me with a solid foundation in computer science principles and various programming languages.

I am passionate about continuous learning and constantly seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in software development. Currently, I am actively working on personal projects and exploring open-source contributions to further enhance my expertise.

Drawing from my experience in problem-solving and meticulous attention to detail as a handyman, I bring a unique perspective to software development. I am excited to leverage my transferable skills, including effective communication and adaptability, to contribute to development teams and deliver high-quality solutions.

I invite you to explore my GitHub account, where I share my ongoing programming projects. While I am still in the early stages of my software development journey, I am committed to continuous growth and eagerly embrace new challenges.

If you are seeking a dedicated and driven software developer with a strong foundation, a passion for learning, and an unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional results, I would be thrilled to collaborate with you on meaningful projects.
